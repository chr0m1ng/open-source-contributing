## Why code reviewing

<https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/standard.html#conflicts>

## What to look in a code review

<https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/looking-for.html>

## As a Reviewer or Author

### Assume competence

An author‚Äôs implementation or a reviewer‚Äôs recommendation may be due to the other party having different context than you. Start by asking questions to gain understanding.

### Provide rationale or context

Such as a best practices document, a style guide, or a design document. This can help others understand your decision or provide mentorship.

### Consider how comments may be interpreted

Be mindful of the differing ways hyperbole, jokes, and emojis may be perceived.

- **BAD example**: `I prefer short names so I‚Äôd rather not change this. Unless you make me? :)`
- **GOOD example**: `Best practice suggests omitting obvious/generic terms. I‚Äôm not sure how to reconcile that advice with this request.`

### Don't criticize the person

Instead, discuss the code. Even the perception that a comment is about a person (e.g., due to using ‚Äúyou‚Äù or ‚Äúyour‚Äù) distracts from the goal of improving the code.

- **BAD example**: `Why are you using this approach? You‚Äôre adding unnecessary complexity.`
- **GOOD example**: `This concurrency model appears to be adding complexity to the code without any visible performance benefit.`

### Don't use harsh language

Code review comments with a negative tone are less likely to be useful.

## As a Reviewer

### Provide specific and actionable feedback

If you don‚Äôt have specific advice, sometimes it‚Äôs helpful to ask for clarification on why the author made a decision.

### Clearly mark nitpicks and optional comments

By using prefixes such as ‚ÄòNit‚Äô, ‚ÄòOptional‚Äô or ‚ÄòSuggestion‚Äô. This allows the author to better gauge the reviewer‚Äôs expectations.

## As an Author

### Naming your PR

`[optional scope] #<task id> Pull request title`

A **scope** may be provided to a PR title to provide additional contextual information and is contained within brackets.

Don't use generic and meaningless names such as `'fix issues'`, `'refactoring'` and so on. Try to be as much precise as you can humanly be when giving your PR a title.

E.g. `[WhatsApp Gateway] Add new message template type`.

### Clarify code or reply to the reviewer's comment in response to feedback

Failing to do so can signal a lack of receptiveness to implementing improvements to the code

- **BAD example**: `That makes sense in some cases but not here`
- **GOOD example**: `I added a comment about why it‚Äôs implemented that way`

> When disagreeing with feedback, explain the advantage of your approach
